# **Anime Recommendation System**

This machine learning project is focused on building a recommendation system for anime shows and movies using collaborative filtering and content-based techniques. Anime has a vast and diverse catalog, making it challenging for viewers to discover titles that match their preferences. This project leverages historical user–anime interaction data to recommend personalized anime, enhancing the user experience and engagement.

## Project Overview
### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable recommendation model that suggests anime titles to users based on their past ratings and preferences. With thousands of anime titles available, users often struggle to find shows they might enjoy. A recommendation system helps solve this by analyzing user behavior and anime attributes to generate tailored suggestions.

### Solution

The project uses machine learning-based recommendation techniques (such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches). By analyzing patterns in user ratings and anime metadata, the system predicts which anime a user is most likely to enjoy.

### Stages of the Project

#### Data Collection and Loading

The dataset includes user ratings, anime titles, genres, and other metadata.

Data is cleaned by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization of rating distributions, popularity trends, and genre frequencies.

Insights into user–anime interactions to understand recommendation patterns.

#### Data Preprocessing

Converting categorical features (e.g., genres) into machine-readable formats.

Handling sparse data in user–item rating matrices.

#### Model Implementation

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests anime by analyzing similarities between users and their preferences.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends anime based on metadata such as genre, type, or episodes.

Hybrid Approaches: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.

#### Recommendation Generation

Predicts anime ratings for users.

Produces a ranked list of recommended titles tailored to each user.

#### Evaluation

Metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to evaluate prediction accuracy.

Precision and Recall at top-K recommendations are analyzed to measure recommendation quality.

### Visualization of Results

Recommended anime lists are presented for sample users.

Visualizations highlight the most popular and most recommended titles across the dataset.

### Technologies and Tools Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis

Scikit-learn: Preprocessing, similarity measures, evaluation metrics

Surprise / implicit: For building collaborative filtering models

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

### Key Features

Personalized anime recommendations based on user history.

Handles large and sparse user–anime interaction data.

Supports both collaborative and content-based filtering.

Extensible design for integrating hybrid recommendation models.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can power personalized recommendation systems in the context of anime. By analyzing user ratings and anime metadata, the system delivers meaningful suggestions that improve user engagement and discovery. The framework can also be extended to other domains such as movies, books, or music recommendation systems.
